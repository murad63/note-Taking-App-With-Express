in this project we will learn: 
    setting up parsers for form
    setting ejs for ejs pages
    setting up public static files

    dynamic routing
    How to get data from frontend at backend rout



to setup the project, first we will cd to enter the project directory.
command: npm init -y 
The command will create basic package.json file
after That we will install express in our project using command: npm i express

1. setting up parsers file form:
    If we open the file package.json, we will watch "main":"index.js". Thats means index.js will be our main file. so lets create it.
    app.use(express.json()); // Convert blob data to JSON data
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // Convert URL-encoded data. This two lines are settings of parser for form.

2. setting ejs for ejs pages: ejs as like html but it has some extra functionality. Suppose <h1>2+2</h1>. The result will be 4.
    first we need to install ejs using command: npm i ejs
    setup ejs as view engine.          app.set('view engine','ejs');

3. Setting up public Static File:
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,"public"))); 
    its used to render image, css and others file from frontend.

4. dynamic routing: dynamic routing prevent render for each one routing like localhost:3000/Profile/abcd localhost:3000/Profile/abc etc.
    Now to make it dynamic we will use simple colon, like localhost:3000/profile:abcd or localhost:3000/profile:anything. after colon its become a variable.
